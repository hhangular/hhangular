## The attribute `qualityRender`

The attribute `qualityRender` changes the quality of the rendering of the miniatures.    
Quality directly affects rendering time. By default the miniatures are rendered with the quality set to `1`. 

Nevertheless, the library [Mozilla pdfjs](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/), uses a system of cache and optimizations.    
Also dynamically change the quality of the rendering, will not have a significant result.
