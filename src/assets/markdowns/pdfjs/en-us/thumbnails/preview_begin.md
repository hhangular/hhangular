# Previewing miniatures

When a miniature is over, a preview appears.

This feature is controlled by 3 attributes.

 - `previewDelay`: Sets the time the thumbnail over before the preview appears.
 - `previewHeight`: Sets the height of the preview.
 - `previewQuality`: Defines the quality of the rendering.

The `0` value of `previewDelay` disables the preview.
