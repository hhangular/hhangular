# The Drag and Drop

The `drag&drop` management is based on 2 attributes dragMode` and `allowDrop`.

 - `dragMode` defines the behavior of the move, whether it is a copy or a move.
 - `allowDrop` defines whether or not the container can receive a miniature from a `drag&drop`.

> This also controls the possibility of reordering miniatures within the same `pdfjs-thumbnails`.

>>> **!!Attention!!** this does not change the `PDF` it is up to you to retrieve the list of modified pages and send them to the server to edit or create a new PDF`.
