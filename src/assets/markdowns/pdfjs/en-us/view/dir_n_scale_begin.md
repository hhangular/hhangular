# Attributes `fit` and` scale` 

The `fit` and` scale` attributes work together.

  - `fit` defines in which direction the page will be fitted.
    - `ViewFit.HORIZONTAL`: defines that the page will be fitted horizontally in the width.
    - `ViewFit.VERTICAL`: defines that the page will be fitted vertically in the height.
 
  - `scale` defines the zoom applied to the fitted page.

A `scale` of 1 therefore defines that the page will be fitted as defined by the` fit` attribute.
