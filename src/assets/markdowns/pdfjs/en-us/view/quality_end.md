```html
<pdfjs-view  [quality]="2"> </pdfjs-view>
```

A quality of `2` is generally sufficient. `1` is clearly not enough for viewing the page.

> The default quality for pages, the `<pdfjs-view>` component is `2`    
> Thumbnails, `<pdfjs-thumbnails>` components have a lower rendering quality of `1` by default.
