# Demo

For the demo, we will implement the usecase mentioned earlier in the documentation.

We will implement a `material` table, with the sortable, hideable columns.

The pagination will allow you to navigate between the different pages of the table

We will also be able to filter the contents of the table with a search field.

Finally, the columns, sorting, pagination and filter will be persisted on the browser.    
So that on the next visit or even by changing the module, the road and then returning to it, the user will find the table as he had left it.

We will start from the example from the `material` website [matTable](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview).

### Implemented features

 - Sorting columns
